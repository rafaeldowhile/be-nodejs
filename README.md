# DEEL BACKEND TASK

## ❗ Dev Notes ❗

> Hello, I have added a few changes to the structure.
> There are no breaking changes. Just a few new files and directories.

### Test

You can use the following command to run.

```
$ npm test
```

First, it's going to run the **pretest** script from package.json. It's going to create a new ``database_testing.sqlite3`` file for testing purposes only.

- A new javascript file has been added in the project at ``scrips/seedDbTesting.js`` - it's a clone from ``scripts/seedDbTesting.js``.

### Sequelize
I have a good understanding of Sequelize, so I tried creating all queries using their tools. I understand that we can split those long queries into smaller chunks to increase the readability.

## Directories

### dev-support

It's just the tools that I used to complete the assessment.

- Postman
- TablePlus

### controllers

The basic structure to move the code from `app.js`. At this directory, there are a few lines of code that could be moved
to another layer - like **services** to isolate the logic for common routines - but since it's a simple code, I considered that it hasn't needed'.

### routes

Just separating the routes in different files to enhance files structure.

### Improvement Checklist 
- [x] Routes
- [x] Controller
- [x] Tests
- [ ] Include express-validator to improve security and standardization
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Refactor **model.js** file. Currently, a newer version of sequelize comes with models/index.js file that improves that readability.
- [ ] Service layer - better remove logic from controllers.
- [ ] Tests for **balances**
- [ ] Improve tests for **jobs**
- [ ] ESLint + prettier 
- [ ] Swagger docs

💫 Welcome! 🎉

This backend exercise involves building a Node.js/Express.js app that will serve a REST API. We imagine you should spend
around 3 hours at implement this feature.

## Data Models

> **All models are defined in src/model.js**

### Profile

A profile can be either a `client` or a `contractor`. clients create contracts with contractors. contractor does jobs
for clients and get paid. Each profile has a balance property.

### Contract

A contract between and client and a contractor. Contracts have 3 statuses, `new`, `in_progress`, `terminated`. contracts
are considered active only when in status `in_progress`
Contracts group jobs within them.

### Job

contractor get paid for jobs by clients under a certain contract.

## Getting Set Up

The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.

1. Start by cloning this repository.


1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.


1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The
   database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.


1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

❗️ **Make sure you commit all changes to the master branch!**

## Technical Notes

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which will automatically restart for you when you modify and
  save a file.

- The database provider is SQLite, which will store data in a file local to your repository called `database.sqlite3`.
  The ORM [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is on top of it. You should only have to interact with Sequelize
    - **please spend some time reading sequelize documentation before starting the exercise.**

- To authenticate users use the `getProfile` middleware that is located under src/middleware/getProfile.js. users are
  authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. after a user is authenticated his profile will be
  available under `req.profile`. make sure only users that are on the contract can access their contracts.
- The server is running on port 3001.

## APIs To Implement

Below is a list of the required API's for the application.

1. ***GET*** `/contracts/:id` - This API is broken 😵! it should return the contract only if it belongs to the profile
   calling. better fix that!

1. ***GET*** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only
   contain non terminated contracts.

1. ***GET*** `/jobs/unpaid` - Get all unpaid jobs for a user (***either*** a client or contractor), for ***active
   contracts only***.

1. ***POST*** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount
   should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

1. ***POST*** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit
   more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum
   of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer>` - returns the clients the paid the most for
   jobs in the query time period. limit query parameter should be applied, default limit is 2.

```
 [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "fullName": "Reece Moyer",
        "paid" : 100.3
    },
    {
        "id": 200,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 99
    },
    {
        "id": 22,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 21
    }
]
```

## Going Above and Beyond the Requirements

Given the time expectations of this exercise, we don't expect anyone to submit anything super fancy, but if you find
yourself with extra time, any extra credit item(s) that showcase your unique strengths would be awesome! 🙌

It would be great for example if you'd write some unit test / simple frontend demostrating calls to your fresh APIs.

## Submitting the Assignment

When you have finished the assignment, create a github repository and send us the link.

Thank you and good luck! 🙏
